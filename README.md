<h2>Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project<h2>

In this repository you will find the R script "run_analysis.R" and the documentation for the course Project "Getting and Cleaning data".  

The dataset for the tasks come from: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a href>

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

The output of the 5th task is called tidydata.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
